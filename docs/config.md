# Configuration Reference

The repository's primary configuration comes from `config.yaml`.  In addition, environment variables may be used to modify some behavior.

## `config.yml`

This YAML file holds the all the relevant settings for this repository in dictionaries:

* `versions`: Versions of the dependency RPMs
* `images`: Build arguments, tags, and other settings for container images
* `maven`: Maven cache URL and SHA1 checksum

Because this file is also used by [shell](../shell) build method (in addition to Vagrant), any relevant variable should have an anchor property (`&`).  This allows a shell script to easily search for a value without using a YAML library.  For example:

```yaml
versions:
  geos: &geos_version: '3.6.2-1'
```

In addition, using anchors allows reuse of the variable without repeating it, for example:

```yaml
images:
  - rpmbuild-gdal:
      args:
        geos_version: *geos_version
```

## Environment Variables

### `HOOT_VERSION_GEN`

This corresponds to the value generated by Hootenanny's [`HOOT_VERSION_GEN`](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/HOOT_VERSION_GEN) and used in the filename for a Hootenanny source archive.
By default the `Makefile` will use the latest Hootenanny archive file in `SOURCES/`; if there's more than one source archive, it may be selected by setting the `HOOT_VERSION_GEN` environment variable when invoking `make`:

```
HOOT_VERSION_GEN=0.2.41_2_g4d31c87 make rpm
```

### `GIT_COMMIT`

When creating a Hootenanny archive, this environment variable can be used for specifying the exact Hootenanny git revision (or tag) that you want with `make`.  For example:

```
# Create archive for Hootenanny revision 4d31c87
GIT_COMMIT=4d31c87 make archive

# Create archive for Hootenanny tag v0.2.41
GIT_COMMIT=v0.2.41 make archive
```

### `MAVEN_CACHE`

Hootenanny uses Maven for building its Java services code, which requires retrieving assets over HTTP.  To prevent frequent timeouts and race conditions a pre-existing cache is downloaded prior to trying to run the `rpmbuild-hoot-release` or `rpmbuild-hoot-devel` containers.   Setting the `MAVEN_CACHE` environment variable to any value other than `1` disables retrieving this cache file.  Example:

```
MAVEN_CACHE=0 vagrant status
```

### `RPMBUILD_UID_MATCH`

By default, the containers use a UID and GID matching the invoking user for `rpmbuild`; doing so prevents permission errors because [Docker bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) are used to share files with the hootenanny containers.  If you want the `rpmbuild` user to have the same UID/GID specified in `config.yml`, set `RPMBUILD_UID_MATCH=0` (any value other than `1`).
